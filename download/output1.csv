There are fine groceries such as Union Market, several good delis, some of the best bagels in New York at the Bagel Hole,etc., as well as restaurants with food from every corner of the globe, ranging from higher end fare at places like Talde to our local diner located right on the corner of the block.

The green taxis work the same as the yellow but are designated specifically to stop in Brooklyn and boroughs other than Manhattan.

Kauai’s north shore is also where you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in Hawaii. There are three main beaches in Princeville, which are Kenomene Beach, Kaweonui Beach and Puu Poa Beach.

Also, please turn off lights in your room if you are leaving for a significant amount of time. If you would like to use the washer and dryer, please talk to me first. Our washer uses concentrated soap and the dryer filter needs to be changed before each load.

There is a walkway at the end of the street to Victoria Park and to Tin Hau, another popular eating area. Causeway Bay shopping Centre is within walking distance.",I am happy to chat via email prior to your stay to help you plan and prepare for your time in Hong Kong Regarding the floor levels: The apartment is officially named as 4/26 Wun Sha. This means it is on the 4th floor (as per British numbering of floors) but the Chinese character outside the apartment door shows it as 5th floor (as per Chinese way of numbering floors). It is 26 as it is on the left of the stairwell - 28 is to the right. You'll know it by the plants by the door as well.,"The MTR in Hong Kong is excellent, providing regular and easy access around the city. The Tin Hau station is a 6-7 minute walk. Buses are available at the end of the street, at a nearby terminus and on several surrounding streets, making travel around Hong Kong very easy. Taxis are also available and cheap.","This is the entire apartment.

I've never had a problem in my 8 years of hosting this apartment - all guests have been extrememly respectful of the space and items in it. Few details to help maintain the 'pest free' and comfort of my home: 1. Please keep the 3 sink holes covered & closed when not in use.  I have no cockroaches etc and ask that drains remain covered to ensure my home remains this way. 2. Walter filter. Water is drinkable from the tap. If you choose to use the filter - please ensure it is only filtered with COLD water. The hot water ruins the filter. 3. Hot water: please leave OFF when not in use - prevents high power costs. It is electric so it'll need 3-5 minutes to hear prior to a shower  4: When going out for the day, or leaving, please ensure the following is turned off: water heater, air-conditioners, lights & coffee machine.

It's quiet because there is almost no traffic. The neighborhood is literally a rain-forest, dominated by native ohia trees and giant tree ferns. Our skies are so dark that on clear nights the Milky Way is stunning. Four minutes from Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island, this is an ideal base for touring the park and is centrally located between Ka'u and Puna. The national park is currently closed except for the Kahuku Unit in Ka'u. In the village there are five restaurants, two general stores, and a post office - check out my Guidebook for the island at the bottom of this listing. A farmer's market is held in the village every Sunday where you can get food, local produce, coffee, honey, and crafts.

MAP CENTER: The map center has maps and brochures, and a map of local restaurants including my own recommendations.  TV: There is a DVD player (no cable or broadcast TV) and toys and games for the kids. COFFEE and TEA: There is complementary coffee and tea by the coffee maker in the kitchen. GROCERIES: If you will be staying a while and doing any cooking, you should get groceries in Kona or Hilo before arriving. There are local general stores, but their selection is limited and the prices are higher. GRILL: If you would like to use the grill please ask. WATER and RAIN: The house is on a catchment water system, which is fine for bathing and washing dishes. Spring water is provided for drinking and cooking. There is cedar paneling throughout, so the house smells like cedar. Please understand that we get 9 FEET (2.7 ",The only public transportation is an infrequent bus to Hilo.

While the first is more bohemian, very lively, famous for its night-life and  next to the Bosporus, the later is much more affluent, elegant and full of specialized restaurants and internationally renown designer shops. Both are pretty, safe, very central and share an exiting lifestyle.  Everything is steps away or very nearby; gorgeous parks, mosques, Taksim and the TOP TOURIST ATTRACTIONS.  I'm surrounded by a huge array of cafes, restaurants, shops, bars and live music venues; all this contributes to making Beşiktaş one of the most sort after districts in Istanbul. Yet I live at a quiet and safe street. Witin 1 to 2 min walk: a hospital and pharmacy (at the corner) 3 supermarkets, including the cheapest chain in all of Turkey.

You could even walk further to GALATA tower within 50 min (20 from Taksim square) and keep going down to Karaköy, only 5 min from Galata and another 10 min to Eminönū to the wonderful Spice bazaar and the Yeni mosque. All together you can walk from home to Eminönū in a bit more than 1 hr.","**There are 3 bus routes that pass by the corner of the flat (130m) They go to TAKSIM, another to EMINÖNŪ (Spice bazaar) Karaköy & Yeni Kapı (very near the Blue mosque). 5 min walk there's the dolmuş (collective taxi) that goes to Taksim  in about 5 min. **Osmanbey metro is 15 min walk. This metro can lead you to Atatūrk airport within one hour with a short-easy change at Yeni Kapı. **Kabataş tram that leaves you at the door of the Blue mosque, Aiğa Sofia,  the spice and Grand Bazaars is 25 min walk or 1 bus ride away from this corner. Optional; taxi to Kabataş in 6 min and costs about €2.5 ** The ferries to Ūskūdar only take 5 minutes to reach ASIA! Or 20 min by luxurious ferry to Kadiköy (only 70 euro cents) From Beşiktaş centre there's another dolmuş to Taksim (5-7 min ride) and a huge selection of buses to go all around and mainly the most beautiful palaces in the city and near the Black Sea at Sarıyer!","You can access all areas except the other bedroom.

This is NOT hipster paradise, and it's NOT gangster's paradise either!  Our neighborhood is very residential and typically quieter than most urban cities. The summertime is louder on the block because very few people have air conditioning and enjoy hanging outside. The neighbors are friendly, so say hello as you pass! The ages of the neighborhood are very diverse (young children to elderly homeowners who have been here for 40 years). Flatbush has a lot of local charm and people with hearts of gold.  Jamaican food is plentiful (jerk chicken- yeah!); there is also a local donut shop nearby, Subway, Thai, sushi, pizza, and Indian food for delivery or a 5-15 minute walk to the restaurant, as well as many chain stores like Dominos, Dunkin' Donuts, IHOP, and Walgreens drug store. There is also a Planet Fitness (handy for Black-Card members!)

CHECK IN: This means, if you are coming in on a red-eye flight and are arriving early in the morning, the previous guest may still be occupying the room until after we have both left for work meetings. As we work and are not a full-time business (just a couple renting out a room to meet awesome travelers), we may not be able to change the sheets and thoroughly clean the room until later in the evening, sometimes as late as 7pm. You are welcome to drop your bags at any time on Check in Day! This is usually no issue 90% of the time. CHECK OUT: Additionally, because of time constraints, we may ask  that you be packed up and OUT of the apartment on the morning of your checkout. You are always welcome to leave your bags, especially for those guests who have late evening flights (Who wants, or COULD, drag all that gear around?!). Thank you so much in","We are located three blocks from the 2,5 trains at Church Avenue.

On y retrouve de nombreuses galeries d'art, des ateliers de designers, des boutiques et des cafés. L'entreprise de logiciels d'infographie 3D Discreet Logic a marqué le quartier en rénovant un étage d'une ancienne usine de textiles au début des années 1990. En 1997, cet espace devient les nouveaux studios montréalais du développeur de jeux vidéo Ubisoft, agrandis par la suite pour occuper la majeure partie de l'immeuble. Le Mile End est nettement plus fortuné et plus populaire depuis le milieu des années 1990 : l'augmentation des loyers et l'apparition de nouvelles boutiques haut de gamme en témoignent. Récemment, le Mile End fut considéré par plusieurs magazines musicaux spécialisés, notamment Spin et Pitchfork, comme le cœur de la scène musicale indépendante de Montréal.

It’s a suburb many aspire to live in and once you’re there, there’s little reason to leave, with plenty of shops along Military Road, stunning scenery and even the iconic Taronga Zoo to keep you amused. Balmoral Beach offers a more relaxed atmosphere, with parks, swimming and beachside cafes. It’s tempting to stay at home and get lost in the harbour view from your balcony, but at some point it’s important to leave the house. A walk through Mosman is an excellent workout due to the inevitable hill-climbing challenges. There’s a community bus for short trips and plenty of buses into the CBD; or the ferry if you prefer a water crossing. Small clumps of village shops include delicatessens, bakeries and specialty gift stores, while the major shopping precinct is located on Military Road.","Bookings made via AirBNB are subject to the standard booking terms and conditions displayed on the Luxico Holiday Homes website.

It's a relatively quiet beach where locals spend hours bathing in the sun. There is a park here with BBQs, toilets, changing rooms and a large grassy area to make a picnic. GREAT OCEAN WALK While you're in the area, you must take the Great Ocean Walk. It's a pathway that hugs the coast line all the way from Bondi to Coogee beach. Thankfully, it crosses your doorstep. Just join the throngs of people making the pilgrimage every day. SCULPTURES BY THE SEA Every year artists erect a series of sculptures along the Great Ocean Walk. It's a magical display set against the ocean views along the walk and it attracts thousands of local people and others from around the world. This year it is happening from 24 October - 10 November.","FREE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE We want you to have a great time when you stay at our place. We like the idea of you sitting out on the balcony celebrating something and admiring the view. So, anyone that books for 3 nights or more will find a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in the fridge upon arrival. SAVING LIVES We are really thankful to live by the beach and it's a stunning beach. One of the things that makes this beach a great place to swim and have fun in summer are the lifesavers who volunteer their time to look after the people who use the beach. Chances are that you've chosen our place partly because of the beach out the front. So to thank the guys that look after the beach for us, 10% of everything that you pay to us will be given to them as a donation. It's the least we can do for the guys that keep the beach safe. We'll send you a copy of the receipt and any comments that we get from them in thanks.",BUSES The local area is serviced by buses that will take you to other transport hubs that will take you anywhere you need to go or you can catch a local bus directly to the CBD and be there in about 15 minutes. You'll have access to the internet from the computer set up for you in the apartment. Just either call 131500 and ask them for help or search 131500 on a search engine and you'll find a website showing all the timetables. You're not too far from anywhere!,"All guests will have free access to all the amenities and facilities in the Apartment. This includes a coffee machine, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, 434 litre fridge, a complete library of books, 54"" TV & DVD Player, wireless broadband internet, sound system and an intercom / security system. TRANSPORT Once you arrive at The BEACHFRONT Apartment you probably won't want to leave. But should the need arise, there is transport immediately out the front. The #361 bus stop is across the ride and it will take you to Bondi Junction or Bondi Beach. From the Junction you can catch buses and trains to the city. The bus is handy, however, most things are within walking distance anyway.","Unfortunately, we don't get to meet the guests.

Chances are, if you survived the pounding shore break at Waimea, you got a load of sand in your bathing suit. This will clog up the plumbing in the shower, so PLEASE leave the sand at the beach or rinse out your suits with the hose before entering the studio. 3) Do not hang beach towels on balcony. DO hang them on the clothesline downstairs. 4) Do not use the white bath towels for food spills, muddy feet or makeup removal, etc. That's what the rags (under the kitchen and bathroom sinks) and black wash towels are for!   5) No extra guests. 6) RESPECT the ocean.
